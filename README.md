# Telegram-Stock-Bot
My own telegram bot which can help me to know price of stock. Now it doesn't have all functions. 
It use:
-aiogram;
-aiohttp;
-bs4;
-requests;

Bot can get price of tickers from rbc.ru. You need just too get the url(I understood that it is stupid idea but...!You can pin a message with url!). You also can see price of 3 tickers from menu.
In the future, the user will be able to make a list of favourite tickers and look for their price.
